The following model is a Pytorch pre-trained model obtained from converting Tensorflow checkpoint found in the [official Google BERT repository](https://github.com/google-research/bert). 

This is one of the smaller pre-trained BERT variants, together with [bert-mini](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-mini) [bert-small](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-small) and [bert-medium](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-medium). They were introduced in the study `Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre-training Compact Models` ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962)), and ported to HF for the study `Generalization in NLI: Ways (Not) To Go Beyond Simple Heuristics` ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01518)). These models are supposed to be trained on a downstream task.

If you use the model, please consider citing both the papers:
